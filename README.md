I have done 2 different projects. second one was not tested.
First One: According to person features, it predicts the possible ad category that he/she could click.(Random Forest Algorithm)
Second One: the prediction of the title whether it is clickable . It evaluate the title strength whether it will get the 'Click' or not by using naive bayes Algorithm.(But unfortunately, data were encoded so it was hard to determine ".,!,etc" characters) But it works in real sentences.
