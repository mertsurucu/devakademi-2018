First One: According to person features, it predicts the possible ad category that he/she could click.(Random Forest Algorithm)
Second One: the prediction of the title whether it is clickable . It evaluate the title rather it will get 'Click' or not by using naive bayes Algorithm.(But unfortunately, data were encoded so it was a hard determine ".,!,etc" characters) But it work is in real sentences.
